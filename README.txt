Telescope-SQL
Overview
Telescope-SQL enables authorized users to query and explore telescope observational data stored in an SQL database. It leverages a structured pipeline of scripts that initialize, shape, and manage data access through a set of pre-defined SQL files.

SQL scripts:
clear.sql – cleans or resets existing data structures
tables.sql – defines the core database schema (tables)
views.sql – creates convenient views or aggregations for querying
user.sql – sets up user roles, permissions, or access controls
inventory.sql – populates data inventory (e.g., instruments, filters, datasets)
order.sql – inserts or organizes observation orders or sequences
morestock.sql – supplements or updates additional data

# Telescope-SQL

## 1. About  
Telescope-SQL is a lightweight framework of SQL scripts designed to provision, reset, and manage telescope observation data within an SQL database. It streamlines setup by enforcing a clear, repeatable script execution order, helping to maintain consistent data structures and access policies.

## 2. Why Use It?  
- **Orderly Setup**: Scripts are designed to run in a specific sequence for safety and predictability.  
- **Clean Initialization**: `clear.sql` ensures a clean starting state before schema changes.  
- **Layered Approach**: Build foundational tables, then derived views, followed by data and permissions.  
- **Access Control**: `user.sql` enables user provisioning—ideal for environments with restricted access.  
- **Incremental Data Loading**: Support phased or batch data imports (`inventory.sql`, `order.sql`, `morestock.sql`).

## 3. Script Order & Purpose  
| Order | Script           | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| 1     | `clear.sql`      | Drops or resets existing tables/views—start fresh. |
| 2     | `tables.sql`     | Creates the core tables for storing telescope data. |
| 3     | `views.sql`      | Defines views or calculated fields for easier querying. |
| 4     | `user.sql`       | Creates database users/roles and assigns permissions. |
| 5     | `inventory.sql`  | Populates inventory-type data (like instruments or targets). |
| 6     | `order.sql`      | Loads observational or process ordering data. |
| 7     | `morestock.sql`  | Adds supplementary data updates or extensions. |

## 4. Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taquito22/Telescope-SQL.git
   cd Telescope-SQL
Ensure a compatible SQL environment is ready (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
Execute each script in the defined order. Example (for PostgreSQL):
\i clear.sql
\i tables.sql
\i views.sql
\i user.sql
\i inventory.sql
\i order.sql
\i morestock.sql
Verify data structure and content; test user-based access and querying via created views.
5. Recommendations & Enhancements
Use Transactions: Wrap each script’s execution in a transaction to ensure atomicity.
Environment Detection: Add logic to detect SQL dialects and adjust scripts dynamically.
Idempotence: Modify scripts to be idempotent—safe to re-run without errors.
Documentation: Annotate each SQL script with comments explaining tables, views, and logic.
Automation: Create a shell or Makefile script to automate the run order for easier maintenance.
6. Future Ideas
Python or CLI wrapper to orchestrate the pipeline automatically.
Version control tracking for schema changes over time.
Extended user management script supporting fine-grained access.
Sample query repository (e.g., commonly executed telescope queries).
